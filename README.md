### About

Since the dawning of the digital era, the living space of man has been gradually and unconsciously replaced by the growing domain of data exchange, solely for the sake of efficiency and functionality. Thinking and Literature, as the most important forms of social life, have become groundless thereby. In order to secure a dwelling place for these activities, we decide to receive contributions (in both English and Chinese) in the name of  *WūJīMāChā Essay+*, with no limitations on theme, material, and inclination. But the major focus will be on various forms of literature (poetry,  prose, novels) and its criticism, as well as works of thought and its criticism.

We believe that the present age is the same as the past, in which man would have to respond to its essential problems and hidden turbulences with the strength of his spirit.
